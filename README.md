# Prodigy Infotech – Task 01: Data Visualization

This repository contains my submission for **Task 01** of the **Data Science Internship** at **Prodigy Infotech**. Through this task, I explored data visualization techniques using a real-world population dataset from the World Bank.

## 📌 Task Overview

**Objective:** Create visual representations (bar charts and histograms) to understand the distribution of population data across different countries and over time.

> 💡 This task helped me enhance my practical understanding of data visualization and taught me how to uncover meaningful insights from raw datasets using Python.  
> I'm participating in this internship to **gain real-world experience, build a strong portfolio, and deepen my knowledge in data science and analytics**.

## 📁 Files Included

- `Prodigy_Infotech_Task_1.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with full code, analysis, and visualizations.
- `World Population Data.csv` – World Bank total population dataset.

## 📊 Visualizations Performed

1. Bar Chart – Top 10 countries by total population  
2. Line Plot – India’s population growth (2015–2023)  
3. Line Plot – Population comparison: India, China, USA  
4. Grouped Bar Chart – Population in 2000, 2010, 2020  
5. Histogram – Population distribution in 2023  
6. Pie Chart – Top 5 countries by population share  
7. Scatter Plot – 1960 vs 2023 population  
8. Area Chart – Top 5 countries' population trends over time
